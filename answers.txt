Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: Git allows us to manage code and data when collaborating as a team. Git tracks modifications
and changes to files allowing multiple developres to work on a project simultaneously while keeping
a history of all changes made to the codebase. If there are issues with the code, git allows us to revert
back to an earlier code version. Additionally, the features of branching and merging make it easier to work 
on features or fixes in isolation before integrating them into the main codebase.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be broadly applied to the entertainment industry, ins areas such as film, television, music, and gaming.
For instance, streaming platforms like Netflix or Spotify use data science to analyze user behavior and preferences to
provide personalized recommendations.By leveraging data on what content users watch, listen to, or engage with, these platforms can suggest
movies, shows, or songs tailored to individual tastes, enhancing user satisfaction.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Git merging combines two branches by creating a merge commit, preserving the history of both branches. Rebasing moves the commits from one branch onto another.

Q3: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: Answer: Some skills I hope to improve during this course is my machine learning knowledge such as learning different algorithms and
how to apply them, data visualization and tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and just how to write clean and effective code for data analysis.
