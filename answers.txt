Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: Git allows us to manage code and data when collaborating as a team. Git tracks modifications
and changes to files allowing multiple developres to work on a project simultaneously while keeping
a history of all changes made to the codebase. If there are issues with the code, git allows us to revert
back to an earlier code version. Additionally, the features of branching and merging make it easier to work 
on features or fixes in isolation before integrating them into the main codebase.
